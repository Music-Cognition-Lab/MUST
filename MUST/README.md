MUST
=========

MUST 1.0 (2018) is a MATLAB toolbox containing a set of functions to analyze the computational properties of musical stimuli saved in MIDI format. A comprehensive description and formulation of the computational measures together with a rationale for their selection can be found in the Appendix B of the following article:

Dependencies
----
This software uses the MIDI toolbox to import the MIDI files into MATLAB, to extract the onset times, the duration and the MIDI pitch of each note event (Toiviainen, P., & Eerola, T. (2016). MIDI Toolbox 1.1. URL: https://github.com/miditoolbox/1.1).


Installation
----
The MUST package does not require any installation. Download and unpack the MUST toolbox and include the package folder in the Matlab path variable.


Examples
----
The package contains a file named "example.m" with an example of use of all the computational measures included in the package.
